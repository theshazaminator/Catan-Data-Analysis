 Score vs Harbor

How many harbors make a winning stragety?

        I wanted to understand whether harbors in Catan are essential to winning. So, I started by trying to find Catan data. I browse through Kaggle (an open database) and found the data under the username "Organ1sm" that had the data I needed. However, there was a lot of data so I had to clean the data to get what I wanted to test. After cleaning I ran the the data 
        through scikit-learn data processing AI to get the K-mean which I found to be 1.3 harbors for a winning startegy. In conclusion, running this analysis shows that getting at least 1 harbor can lead to a winning strategy.
